# Resonant Organisms

![Resonant Organisms](./SCREENSHOT.png)

Playground for **generative organisms**: procedural morphogenesis, material textures, and saveable specimen state (`.organism` files).

Shape families include torus and knots, minimal surfaces (Chen–Gackstätter, López–Ros), Gielis superformula solids, Baschet-inspired leaf resonators, and loaded GLB models. Deform with noise, dress with glass/physical materials and HDR/EXR environments, then keep iterating on a specimen with load / save.

## Acoustic model (torus-first)

Chamber detection and the Pd-style patch (`osc~` / `reson~`) were **designed for deformed tori**: bulges along the ring become resonance chambers linked in a serial chain.

On other shapes the analyzer still runs, but results are unreliable, it basically picks random bulges that are not consistent with the model geometry. Treat acoustics as experimental outside the torus; the morphogenesis side is the broader playground.
